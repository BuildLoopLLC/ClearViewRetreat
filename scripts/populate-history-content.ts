    content: `Jim and Kim Nestle established Intentional Intimacy International (III) in the spring of 2008. Their vision was born from a deep conviction that families need intentional time away from the distractions of daily life to focus on what matters most‚Äîtheir relationships with God and each other.

<p>After years of ministry experience and witnessing the struggles families face in maintaining strong, Christ-centered relationships, Jim and Kim felt called to create a space where families could step away from their busy schedules and reconnect with their faith and each other.</p>

<p>The retreat center was strategically located in the beautiful mountains of Tennessee, providing a natural setting that would help families disconnect from technology and reconnect with God's creation. The name "ClearView" was chosen to reflect the clarity of vision and purpose that families often discover during their time at the retreat.</p>

<p>From the beginning, the mission was clear: to provide a Christ-centered environment where families could experience spiritual renewal, strengthen their relationships, and return home with a renewed sense of purpose and connection.</p>`,
