We enjoy each other and desire to glorify God in our interactions. Why did God bless us with the home life that we have? Certainly not because we deserve "wedded bliss" and "great kids" more than any other couple or family, but simply because He chose to lead us as we sought His will in our home. He has taught us principles for relating, for living life with <em className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">intentional intimacy</em>, and we want to share this with others.`,

A former naval officer who served as a Division Officer, Jim also held a nurse supervisory position in the Surgery Department of Johns Hopkins Hospital for three years, overseeing the management of 220 beds and the staff that performed direct patient care. During these last years, God has called Jim to challenge the men, women, and children he has mentored/counseled to be intentionally intimate in the relationships they held dear. Through this time, he realized the need for more families to see what God really intends in relationships. Jim volunteered at a <a href="http://sonrisemountainranch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 underline">small group, family-focused retreat</a> for five weeks during the summer of 2007 to see if God was, indeed, calling his family to this life-changing ministry. These leadership positions and volunteer experience uniquely qualify him to lead staff in day-to-day duties and guests in small group discussions. Currently, Jim works full-time as an RN, trains in blacksmithing, mentors marriages, and runs CVR.`,
